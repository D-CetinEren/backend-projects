- **List Tasks**:
  - List all tasks.
  - List tasks by their status: "todo," "in-progress," or "done."
  - Filter tasks by creation date range using `--start-date` and `--end-date`.
- **Task Properties**:
  - Unique ID
  - Description
  - Status (todo, in-progress, done)
  - Creation Date
  - Last Updated Date
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration using YAML files
- **Structured Error Handling**: Custom error types for better error management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for task operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling and cleanup
- **Logging**: Detailed logging with timestamps and relevant details
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test cases for all commands

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later installed.
- Git installed.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D-CetinEren/backend-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-projects/go/task-tracker
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o task-tracker
   ```
5. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   ./task-tracker
   ```

## Usage

Below are examples of how to use the CLI commands:

### Add a Task

```bash
./task-tracker add "Buy groceries"
```

### Update a Task

```bash
./task-tracker update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
```

### Delete a Task

```bash
./task-tracker delete 1
```

### Mark a Task

- Mark as in-progress:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker mark-in-progress 1
  ```
- Mark as done:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker mark-done 1
  ```

### List Tasks

- List all tasks:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker list
  ```
- List tasks by status:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker list --status todo
  ./task-tracker list --status in-progress
  ./task-tracker list --status done
  ```
- List tasks created after a specific date:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker list --start-date 2025-01-01
  ```
- List tasks created before a specific date:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker list --end-date 2025-01-10
  ```
- List tasks within a date range:
  ```bash
  ./task-tracker list --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-01-10
  ```

## Configuration

Task Tracker supports flexible configuration using YAML files. Configuration allows you to customize settings such as storage paths and log file locations.

### Default Configuration

If no configuration file is provided, Task Tracker uses default settings:

- **Storage Path**: Current directory (`./tasks.json`)

- **Log Path**: `./logs/task-tracker.log`

### Custom Configuration

1. **Create a configuration file** (e.g., `config.yaml`) in the project directory:
   ```yaml
   storage_path: "./data/tasks.json"
   log_path: "./logs/task-tracker.log"
   ```

2. **Run the CLI with the configuration file:**

   Modify the `main.go` if necessary to accept a configuration file path or place the `config.yaml` in the default configuration directory.

## Logging


Logs are stored in the `logs/task-tracker.log` file. Each operation is logged with a timestamp and relevant details, aiding in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
